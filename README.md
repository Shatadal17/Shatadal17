🚀 About Me

👋 Hi, I'm Shatadal Chakraborty — an aspiring Data Scientist and Physics graduate passionate about transforming data into actionable insights.

🎓 With a background in Physics (Honours) and a growing expertise in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Business Intelligence, I love solving real-world problems through data-driven approaches.

💼 I’ve completed a remote internship at Unified Mentor, where I worked on end-to-end data analysis and machine learning projects, including EV Sales Prediction and Laptop Price Analysis.

🧠 My technical toolbox includes Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost), SQL, Power BI, and Excel, along with a keen interest in AI, automation, and predictive modeling.

📞 I also bring 5 months of professional experience as a Customer Support Executive, which helped me develop strong communication, analytical thinking, and client-handling skills.

🌱 I believe in continuous learning — whether it’s mastering a new Python library, exploring Generative AI, or building meaningful data projects that make an impact.

💡 "From Physics equations to data predictions — I’m on a journey to decode the world through data."
